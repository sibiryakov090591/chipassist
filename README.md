Amplify adds a trailing slash to prevent urls like /about.html but that's probably not the real cause. Your app/browser is making requests to the server with routes that don't exist server-side (you're using SPA routes which are strictly client-side). Try adding the following redirect rule in the amplify js console (under App Settings: Redirects and rewrites > Edit > Open Text Editor):

[
    {
        "source": "</^[^.]+$|\\.(?!(css|gif|ico|jpg|js|png|txt|svg|woff|ttf|map|json)$)([^.]+$)/>",
        "target": "/",
        "status": "200",
        "condition": null
    }
]
